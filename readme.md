Nearly half of the observations were removed due to having null values.

## Summary 

In the exploration, I gained plenty useful insights onto the dataset.

Questiuons I had before conducting the analysis:

- what makes a game more sell more, what geners are more popular in certain markets?

- find out if the socre of the game actully influences sales or not?

After conducting the analysis i have answered these questions and more relavent questions:

- Critics score does have an imapact on global sales.

- Users score does have an imapact on global sales.

- Rating E(for everyone) sells the most in all regions.

- Sports, Action, and Racing games sell the most globally.

- Fighiting, and Role-Playing games are mostly aimed towards teens.

- All the popular genres sell more on PS4.
